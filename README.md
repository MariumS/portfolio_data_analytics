<c>Determining_Eviction_Correlates</c>
Assignment for URPL-GP 2618: Geography Systems and Analysis, taught by Stephanie Rosoff
Central Question: How the amount of evictions and eviction filings in a census tract connected to the presence and number of CitiBike stations in that tract.
Bike sharing is accessed much less by lower income populations, and the presence of bike sharing stations is thought to be correlated with the gentrification of a neighborhood.
Why it matters: According to availible research, bike sharing is accessed much less by lower income populations, and the presence of bike sharing stations is thought to be correlated with the gentrification of a neighborhood. A symptom of gentrification is the removal of previous residents from their neighborhoods due to increasing lack of affordable rent. 
Tools used: ArcGIS
Result: We found a slight decrease in eviction filing counts, eviction filings per person, eviction counts, and eviction counts per person with the increase in CitiBike stations. However, eviction rate showed no pattern. Clearer variations were seen in poverty rate and median household income, with poverty rate decreasing and median household income increasing with each progressively larger bin of CitiBike counts. This corroborates previous research. 
Next Steps: The slight negative correlation between eviction rates and CitiBike presence may be due to the census tracts, 217 out of Brooklyn’s total 841, having already undergone the population shift associated with gentrification. Additionally to honing our 2016 analysis, we would like to look at historical eviction data, and compare that to the current presence of CitiBike stations. This is to attempt a conclusion about evictions leading to a population
shift, which we can then correlate with CitiBike Station presence.
