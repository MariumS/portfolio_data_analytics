Assignment for URPL-GP 2618: Geography Systems and Analysis, taught by Stephanie Rosoff
Central Question: How the amount of evictions and eviction filings in a census tract connected to the presence and number of CitiBike stations in that tract.
Bike sharing is accessed much less by lower income populations, and the presence of bike sharing stations is thought to be correlated with the gentrification of a neighborhood.
<br>
Why it matters: According to availible research, bike sharing is accessed much less by lower income populations, and the presence of bike sharing stations is thought to be correlated with the gentrification of a neighborhood. A symptom of gentrification is the removal of previous residents from their neighborhoods due to increasing lack of affordable rent. 
<br>

Tools used: ArcGIS
<br>

Result: We found a slight decrease in eviction filing counts, eviction filings per person, eviction counts, and eviction counts per person with the increase in CitiBike stations. However, eviction rate showed no pattern. Clearer variations were seen in poverty rate and median household income, with poverty rate decreasing and median household income increasing with each progressively larger bin of CitiBike counts. This corroborates previous research. 
<br>

Next Steps: The slight negative correlation between eviction rates and CitiBike presence may be due to the census tracts, 217 out of Brooklynâ€™s total 841, having already undergone the population shift associated with gentrification. Additionally to honing our 2016 analysis, we would like to look at historical eviction data, and compare that to the current presence of CitiBike stations. This is to attempt a conclusion about evictions leading to a population
shift, which we can then correlate with CitiBike Station presence.

Assignment for Civic Analytics & Urban Intelligence, taught by Neil Kleiman and Alexander Shermansong
<br>

Abstract: Relevant city, state and private interests should install air quality sensors on a sample of MTA buses that cover all bus routes. These sensors will transmit real-time data on PM 2.5, Nitrous Oxide, and Black Carbon to a central database, which will be publically accessible as open data. This project will benefit environmental researchers, help set and monitor emissions standards, and lead to the improving of public health. In the long run it will provide a proof of concept to other cities, and allow for the expanding of mobile air quality monitoring across the globe.
